# Person Owes Person
## Introduction
The idea of this repo is to convert a joke that Iâ€™ve heard online into code. The joke was about three people: $A$, $B$, and $C$; each one owes the other one 20$. $A$ has 5$ in his balance. Therefore, anyone who has money in his balance has to pay the one who owes him, so they can pay the debt slowly. 

$A$ owes $B$ 20$ \
$B$ owes $C$ 20$ \
$C$ owes $A$ 20$

$A$'s balance = 5 \
$B$'s balance = 0 \
$C$'s balance = 0
